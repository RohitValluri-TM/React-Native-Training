To write a custom hook in React Native, you can follow these steps:

Create a new function that starts with the word "use" and has a descriptive 
name that represents the functionality of the hook.

Inside the function, declare any state variables that the hook will need 
using the useState hook.

Implement any logic or functionality that the hook will need to perform, 
such as fetching data from an API or updating state based on user input.

Return any state or functions that the component using the hook will need to access.

Use the custom hook in any component by calling it like a regular function 
at the top level of the component.

It's worth noting that hooks can only be called at the top level of a component or
 other hook, not inside loops or conditions.

Also, you need to make sure you are using the latest version 
of React Native which supports hooks.

Here is an example of a custom hook called useCounter that maintains a 
count state and an increment function:

import { useState } from 'react';

function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }
  return { count, increment };
}


Use it now:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import useCounter from './useCounter';

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment } = useCounter();
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button onPress={increment} title="Increment" />
    </View>
  );
}
